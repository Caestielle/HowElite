This addon simply aims to make the default UnitFrames a bit more fun without adding any extra functionality.

It expands on the traditional elite player frame addons to create "tiers of eliteness" :)

As you increase through the brackets 0-9, 10-19, ..., to 60, the elite frame improves with you 

from default through bronze, silver and so on

As a fun extra, target frames of players will also follow the same "progression"
Lvl ?? enemy players will have a unique frame to easily identify that you will die :)

Given i am a turtle wow Hardcore Mode junkie
PvP flagged Players regardless of Faction or Level will have distinct Green or Red Elite Frames to make them stand out
